# Media coverage of climate change and how wars impact it
## Case study of Palestine's war

Climate change is a pressing global issue that has been receiving increasing media coverage in recent years. Media platforms are providing a conflicting perspective on the issue of climate change. Journalists and news outlets are reporting on what might seem to be a significant cause of climate change such as consumer behavior. Indeed, Media is marginalizing the influence of other important causes such as military activities and weapons such as bombs and missiles. The effects of climate change can be seen in various regions around the world, the issue is particularly relevant in regions that are already prone to war and military attacks. One such region is Palestine, where the ongoing Israel’s invasion of Palestine has had a significant impact on the environment and climate. For example, Israel’s military practices including air forces and missiles attacking Palestine with huge numbers of weapons and bombs.

The video below is demonstrating an interview with an 86 year old man who lived during the Israel’s occupation of Palestine which has lasted for 75 years since 1948 until today. He witnessed different stages of the war of Israel’s occupation of Palestine which ended with the foundation of Israel and the Nakba of 1948 which means the incident of killing and displacing Palestinians from their homes. The second interviewee is a chemical engineer and an environment advocate who provided insightful knowledge about the climate change scientific causes and her perspective about media coverage of the issue.

The war in Palestine has led to a displacement of many local residents, who are forced to flee their homes and communities as a result of the attacks. In the video a case study interview was conducted with Ibrahim Al-Muqbel, providing a first-hand experience of living under attacks of bombs and weapons. Where the consumer himself was at a life-threatening event. He spoke of the emotional trauma he experienced as he was forced to leave behind his home, possessions and community.

The chemical engineer, Dana Al-Muqbel, mentioned that 6% of climate change is caused by military weapons and bombs (Inventory of U.S. Greenhouse Gas Emissions and Sinks, 2022). This is considered a high persentage, yet media is marginalizing the influence and foces on other causes related to consumer behaviour. Military activities also deplete the ozone layer by introducing nitrogen oxides (NOx) into the stratosphere — an estimated 30% by weight are released by each operational aircraft, missile or rocket launch (Sharon et al., 2008).

In Palestine, the effects of climate change are exacerbated by the ongoing war and the use of military weapons. The use of heavy artillery, tanks, and other military equipment has caused widespread destruction of the natural environment, including the destruction of forests, wetlands, and other vital ecosystems. This has led to a loss of biodiversity and a reduction in the ability of the land to absorb carbon and other greenhouse gases, contributing to the overall warming of the planet. 

According to Petras (2006), US is backing Israel unconditionally by providing financial and advanced weapon equipment support to bomb Palestine and Gaza strike resulting in massive number of people being killed and high amount of fossil fuel burnt. On contrast, the United States Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) is working towards reducing emissions globally!

People in Palestine today are still being bombed, the Sheikh Jarrah incident refers to the forced eviction of Palestinian families from their homes in the Sheikh Jarrah neighborhood of East Jerusalem. The evictions have been met with widespread protests and international condemnation, with many accusing Israel of violating international law and committing human rights abuses. The number of people killed during the incident is () which was the result of many bombs dropped all over Palestine's cities.

Environmental awareness is certainly an important topic. But while we do have to care about our environment, surely environment advocates can also be accused of being more concerned with saving the planet than saving lives. We must ask ourselves why we are bombarded with having an environmental-friendly life when missiles and nuclear bombs are killing people and destroying the Ozone layer that protects our planet.

Despite the significant impact of the war on the environment and climate in Palestine, media coverage of this issue has been relatively limited. Many mainstream media outlets have focused consumer behaviour, rather than the impact of bombs and weapons of the attcher on the environment and climate. This lack of coverage has made it difficult for the international community to fully understand the extent of the problem and to take action to address it.

Detecting a specific reason behind the less media attention on the effect of wars on climate change can be difficult and complicated. some possible reasons might be because of the significant amount of media coverage of Wars, and as a result, less attention is given to the effects of these wars on climate change. However, political hidden agenda should be considered as a possible reason because some governments and political groups may not want to draw attention to the environmental impact of wars, as it may reflect poorly on their actions or policies. 

**Survey results:**

After doing interviews with 13 students in the University of Essex in the UK. I asked them the following question "Is the effect of wars on climate change being addressed enough in the media?". The results of the statistics ,as shown in the pie chart below, are 17% of them said yes and 83% of them said no. Students who said yes justified their answer by claiming that media is focusing on many causes and wars are one of of causes mentioned. on the other hand, students who said no, justified their answer by claiming that when they think about climate change, the first cause that pops in their mind is plastics and consumer behaviour. One of the students said that there is more focus on sustainability and environemntal-friendly lifestyle in media which made the effect of bigger causes marginalized.

In conclusion, the ongoing wars in Palestine and other parts of the world has had a significant impact on the environment and climate globally. The use of military weapons has caused widespread destruction of the natural environment, while displacement and loss of traditional knowledge have made it more difficult for local communities to adapt to the changing climate. However, the issue has received limited media coverage, making it difficult for the international community to fully understand the extent of the problem and to take action to address it.
