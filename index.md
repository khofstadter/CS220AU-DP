## Introduction
Before I started teaching the Autumn part of the Navigating the Digital World module in 2021 (the CS220AU) at the University of Essex, the module primarily looked at the field of digital identities and the digital world (e.g., password management, CV enhancements, the use of certain software and hardware for content production<!-- what else?-->).

<!-- explain that AU is more practical and SP more theoretical? -->

There was nothing wrong with this, of course. However, to make the module more in line with my own expertise and interests and more engaging for students, since 2021, my students have been developing their professional identities via setting up their own websites for resident modes of engagement with the Web for their assignments (instead of simply submitting an essay in a Word or PDF file). This decision was based on my previous success at Anglia Ruskin University using this method [^Hofstadter2019SelfAndPeerAssessmentToolAndRationale] and inspired by Dave White discussing the benefits of students developing their resident modes of engagement with the Web not after graduation, but while being students.[^DaveWhite2014] 

[^Hofstadter2019SelfAndPeerAssessmentToolAndRationale]: Hofstädter, Krisztián. 2019 Self and peer assessment tool and rationale. This document was submitted as part of my Learning and Teaching (Higher Education) PG Certificate course at Anglia Ruskin University, Cambridge.

[^DaveWhite2014]: White, Dave. 2014 Visitors and Residents: Credibility. Oxford University. Published on [Youtube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kO569eknM6U). 

My first cohorts in 2021 could develop their websites with any website builder (e.g., [WordPress](https://wordpress.org/), [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com/), [Wix](https://www.wix.com/)) and populate them with whatever content they thought could help showcase their professional identities (e.g., CVs, portfolios, artistic work, blog posts). <!-- I could help them with WordPress and GitHub Pages. Actually they all had to have a GitHub account, but the website didn't have to be with GitHub. -->

In 2022, I refined the assignment and asked students to only develop websites with GitHub Pages, which helped produce more consistent portfolios across the cohort <!-- which then is easier to mark --> and allowed me to better monitor the development of these websites via students' GitHub repositories. Furthermore, to make the module more timely, I asked students to produce content for their websites that link digital identities and existential risks. Their content could either reflect on all the links they found or on one more specifically. Inspired by the decolonizing of the curriculum movement<!-- it's not a movement, what is it --> [^Arshad2021], I thought existential risks were also important, if not more important matters, of which students should be aware.

[^Arshad2021]: Arshad, Rowena 2021 Decolonising the curriculum – how do I get started? Published in [Times Higher Education](https://www.timeshighereducation.com/campus/decolonising-curriculum-how-do-i-get-started).

Feedback from students was positive, so the 2023 assignment brief was to look at the connections between digital identities and existential risks again, but this year, everyone has to<!-- change to had to later--> focus on **one** specific connection to reflect on using their websites.

After outlining how the module 'evolved in my hands', I will 
1. briefly discuss how using using ideas from Agile Project Management helps students' progress in their assignments and then
2. outline how we have been connecting digital identities to existential risks

## Progress = happiness
### Log, tasks lists, commit history, weekly student updates, workshops
Keeping track of each other's work via logs, task lists in student's public repositories, and weekly updates at the start of each class is important for several reasons. This practice keeps us accountable. We have got to do our work and if we don't people will see, it's just like in a real-world environment. Also, this practice encourages transparency and collaborative skills (e.g. they are encouraged to help each other), which is a key aspect of teamwork. For the teachers, me, this practice allows me to see which student needs help and where (e.g. does a student need more technical support with content production or support with theory or overall research methodology). Seeing the progress of each others' work should boost students' motivation and engagement with the assignment. 

At ARU, I got used to syllabuses starting with weekly lectures and seminars and ending with three weeks of workshops, in which the focus is on understanding how students progressed so far and how the teacher can help untangle issues together with the group or individually with students. This time is very special. <!-- reference to Richard, CMT, ARU -->

## Linking the Fields
I certainly have an interest in both fields, but since I am trained as a creative technologist (I got a PhD in developing brain-computer music interfaces for meditation and have been producing audio-visual content as well as websites), and not as an existential risk 'person', my expertise lies more in the field of the digital world and not in existential risks. One might ask the question, "Why then are you teaching existential risks?" Well, I don't. My syllabus focuses on making sure students understand what digital identities are primarily through White and Le Cornu's Visitors and Residence method [^DaveWhite2017] and then provides both academic research frameworks for students to first immerse in both fields and their intersections<!-- APM--> and professional content production skills <!-- GitHub, Markdown, writing and audio-visual --> to then engage with these intersections.<!-- I distinguish between these two -->  <!-- What are the A/Ds of not being an expert in existential risks? Do the disadvantages make me fell uncomfortable? -->

#### links
1. who made connections already (i.e. literature review) ?
2. how can we find more connections (e.g. via the use our own evolving list of keywords and by highlighting not-well-known connections or perhaps making new ones)?
3. how shall students choose a connection to focus on for the assignments? <!-- they should find something they are interested in, as this interest will (or should) help create a momentum/drive to progress with the assignment. -->
4. how could we draft a visual representation of the two fields that could help understand connections?

## Conclusion
### Recommendations
Based on what I have learnt while doing the research for this paper these are my recommendations for teachers and students: 

### Next Steps
My next steps to further develop this module are 

- to consider asking CS220AU students to submit a short video summarizing their portfolios, similarly to my Sonic Art students in 2019:
