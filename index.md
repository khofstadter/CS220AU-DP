## Introduction
Before I started teaching the Autumn part of the Navigating the Digital World module in 2021 (the CS220AU) at the University of Essex, the module primarily looked at the field of digital identities (DIs) and the digital world (e.g., password management, CV enhancements, the use of certain software and hardware for content production, the visitor and resident map <!-- what else?-->).

<!-- explain that AU is more practical and SP more theoretical? -->

To make the module more in line with my own expertise and interests and more engaging for students, since 2021, my students have been developing their professional identities via setting up their own websites for resident modes of engagement with the Web for their assignments (instead of simply submitting an essay in a Word or PDF file). This decision was based on my previous success using this method at another university [^Hofstadter2019SelfAndPeerAssessmentToolAndRationale] and inspired by Dave White discussing the benefits of students developing their resident modes of engagement with the Web not after graduation but while being students.[^DaveWhite2014]

This document was submitted as part of my Learning and Teaching (Higher Education) PG Certificate course at Anglia Ruskin University, Cambridge.

[^DaveWhite2014]: White, Dave. 2014 Visitors and Residents: Credibility. Oxford University. Published on [Youtube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kO569eknM6U). 

My first cohorts in 2021 were allowed to develop their websites with any website builder (e.g., [WordPress](https://wordpress.org/), [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com/), [Wix](https://www.wix.com/)) and populate them with whatever content they thought could help showcase their professional identities (e.g., CVs, portfolios, artistic work, blog posts). <!-- I could help them with WordPress and GitHub Pages. Actually, they all had to have a GitHub account, but the website didn't have to be on GitHub. -->

In 2022, I refined the assignment and asked students to only develop websites with GitHub Pages, which helped produce more consistent portfolios across the cohort <!-- which then is easier to mark -->, allowed me to better monitor the development of these websites via students' GitHub repositories and develop students understanding of the very basics of how websites are built; with code. Furthermore, to make the module more timely, I asked them to produce content for their websites that links DIs and existential risks (ERs). Their content could either reflect on all the links they found or on one more specifically. Inspired by the decolonizing of the curriculum movement<!-- it's not a movement, what is it --> [^Arshad2021], I thought existential risks were also important, if not more important matters, of which students should be aware.

[^Arshad2021]: Arshad, Rowena 2021 Decolonising the curriculum – how do I get started? Published in [Times Higher Education](https://www.timeshighereducation.com/campus/decolonising-curriculum-how-do-i-get-started).

Feedback from students was positive, so the 2023 assignment brief was to look at the connections between DIs and ERs again, but this year, everyone had to<!-- change to had to later--> focus on **one** specific connection to reflect on using their websites.

After outlining how the module 'evolved in my hands', I will 
1. briefly discuss how using ideas from Agile Project Management (APM) aims to help students progress with their assignments and then
2. outline how we have been DIs to ERs

## Progress = happiness
### Log, task lists, commit history, weekly student updates, workshops
Keeping track of each other's work via logs, task lists in students' public repositories, and weekly updates at the start of each class is important for several reasons. This practice keeps us accountable. We have got to do our work and if we don't people will see, it's just like in a real-world environment. Also, this practice encourages transparency and collaborative skills (e.g. they are encouraged to help each other), which is a key aspect of teamwork. For the teachers, me, this practice allows me to see which student needs help and where (e.g. does a student need more technical support with content production or support with theory or overall research methodology). Seeing the progress of each other's work should boost students' motivation and engagement with the assignment. 

At ARU, I got used to syllabuses starting with weekly lectures and seminars and ending with three weeks of workshops, in which the focus is on understanding how students progressed so far and how the teacher can help untangle issues together with the group or individually with students. This time is (or should be!) very special. <!-- reference to Richard, CMT, ARU -->

## Linking the Fields
I certainly have an interest in both fields, but since I am trained as a creative technologist (I recently got a PhD in developing brain-computer music interfaces for meditation and have been producing audio-visual content as well as websites for decades), and not as an existential risk 'person<!-- find a better word -->', my expertise lies more in the field of the digital world and not in existential risks. So one might ask, "Why then are you teaching existential risks?" Well, I don't. My syllabus focuses on making sure students understand what DIs are primarily through White and Le Cornu's Visitors and Residence method [^DaveWhite2017] and then provides both academic research frameworks for students to first immerse in both domains (DI and ER) and their intersections<!-- APM--> and professional content production skills <!-- GitHub, Markdown, writing and audio-visual --> to then engage with these intersections.<!-- I distinguish between these two -->  <!-- What are the A/Ds of not being an expert in existential risks? Do the disadvantages make me feel uncomfortable? -->

### Definitions and Classifications
The best way to progress is, obviously, to first understand what DIs and ERs are, so let's define them and classify their types. One method that can help us understand DIs is the Visitors and Residents Map, developed by White and Le Cornu. It is based on people's motivation to engage with the Web and has two modes: visitor and resident modes, and is further refined by whether we engage in an activity in a personal or an institutional (professional) manner. In a nutshell, in visitor mode activities **we don't leave a social trace behind** (e.g., searching/reading information on the Web, watching videos, shopping, paying our bills). (Remember that search engines could store your search history and website cookies can crawl data from you even in your visiting modes!) In resident mode activities we are present with other people and **leave a social trace behind**. A footprint of our activities stays online after we leave the internet (e.g., by creating content or commenting on other people's content on online platforms [websites, social media]). As these activities are public, they can be linked to our identities, and therefore we should exercise caution while using the Web in this mode. (We should be careful when we use our visitor modes as well, of course!) An example of personal engagement is using social media or emails to communicate with friends and family about personal matters. An example of professional activities is disseminating or discussing ideas as a worker or a student in higher education (HE) online (or print).

The VR map: 

![](assets/img/vr-map-plain.svg)

Students are first asked to discuss where they feel most of their activity is on the VR map at the moment, and then how they envision their activities on this map in a couple of years. The discussions resulting from these questions should help students become motivated to start developing their professional, resident mode of engagement with the Net. Understanding the benefits of consistently developing their unique voices on their websites, which they have full control over, is important. This not only aids in their professional growth but also empowers them to make meaningful contributions to the world.

| Artificial Intelligence (AI) | Anthropogenic | Unpredictable  |
| Biotechnology risks          | Anthropogenic | Predictable?   |


### How to find the links between these domains?
1. who made connections already (i.e. literature review) ?
2. how can we find more connections (e.g. via the use our own evolving list of keywords and by highlighting not-well-known connections or perhaps making new ones)?
3. how shall students choose a connection to focus on for the assignments? <!-- they should find something they are interested in, as this interest will (or should) help create a momentum/drive to progress with the assignment. -->
4. how could we draft a visual representation of the two fields that could help understand connections?

### Ideas for research questions and objectives
<!-- add ideas explore by students in 2022/23 -->

**Understanding and Improving DI**

1. How is my DI (or are my DIs) linked to an ER in both visiting and resident modes?
2. How can I enhance my professional DI to better understand an ER?
3. How can I use my DI to effectively communicate my research findings on an ER to others?
4. How can I assist others in improving their DIs for effective communication of their findings or our collective findings?
5. What techniques can be used to measure the effectiveness of my DI in understanding an ER?
6. Are there any common obstacles to enhancing DI, and how can they be overcome?


**Demographics and DI Usage**

1. Is there a difference in how various demographic groups (e.g., generations, cultures, geopolitical locations) use their DIs in consuming and sharing ideas about ERs? How does this relate to sensemaking?
2. Are there observable trends in DI usage over time within these demographic groups?


**DI in Popular Culture and Geopolitics**

1. How have the links between DIs and ERs been represented in popular culture, such as science fiction literature or films?
2. How is warfare linked to ERs and DIs, especially in the context of current geopolitical situations (e.g., Palestine, Ukraine, etc.)?
3. How have perceptions of DIs and their links to ERs changed over time, particularly in response to global events?
4. Can popular culture influence the development and use of DIs to communicate ERs more effectively, and if so, how?


**The Impact of DI Energy Consumption and Perception**

1. What is the relationship between DIs, energy consumption, and ERs? 
2. How does engaging in war games using our DIs influence our perception of information on current wars presented in the media?
3. Are there ways to minimize the energy consumption of DIs without compromising their effectiveness?
4. How does the energy consumption of DIs impact their accessibility and usability?


**Misinformation and DI**

1. What are the links between DIs and misinformation, and how can this connection escalate ERs?
2. What strategies can be employed to combat misinformation spread through DIs?
3. How can users of DIs be educated about the risks and realities of misinformation?
