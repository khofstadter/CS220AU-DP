## Introduction
Before I started teaching the Autumn part of the Navigating the Digital World module in 2021 (the CS220AU) at the University of Essex, it primarily looked at the field of digital identities and the digital world (e.g., password management, CV enhancements, the use of certain software and hardware for content production<!-- what else?-->).

<!-- explain that AU is more practical and SP more theoretical? -->

There was nothing wrong with this, of course. However, to make the module more in line with my own expertise and interests and more engaging for students, from 2021 onwards, my students have been developing their professional identities via setting up their own websites for resident modes of engagement with the web for their assignments (instead of simply submitting an essay in a Word or PDF file). This decision was based on my previous success at Anglia Ruskin University using this method. [^Hofstadter2019SelfAndPeerAssessmentToolAndRationale]

My first cohorts in 2021 could develop their websites with any website builder (e.g., [WordPress](https://wordpress.org/), [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com/), [Wix](https://www.wix.com/)) and populate them with whatever content they thought could help showcase their professional identities (e.g., CVs, portfolios, artistic work, blog posts). <!-- I could help them with WordPress and GitHub Pages. Actually they all had to have a GitHub account, but the website didn't have to be with GitHub. -->

In 2022, I refined the assignment and asked students to only develop websites with GitHub Pages, which helped produce more consistent portfolios across the cohort and allowed me to better monitor the development of these websites via students' GitHub repositories. Furthermore, to make the module more timely, I asked them to produce content on these websites that links digital identities and existential risks. This content could either reflect all the links they found or one more specifically. Inspired by the 'decolonizing of the curriculum' movement, I thought there were other, perhaps more urgent matters students should be aware of as well.

Feedback was positive, so the 2023 assignment brief was to look at the connections between digital identities and existential risks again, but this year, everyone had to find one specific connection to reflect on using their websites.

<!-- I also have an interest in both fields, but I would say I am more of an expert in the field of digital identities than existential risks. -->

## Conclusion
### Recommendations
These are my recommendations for teachers and students: 

### Next Steps
My next steps to further develop this module are 

- to consider asking CS220AU students to submit a short video summarizing their portfolios, similarly to my Sonic Art students in 2019:
