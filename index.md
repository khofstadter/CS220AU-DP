Today, data has become so big that it cannot be separated from our lives. Data is being generated at a very fast pace. Statista predicts that the amount of total data (the volume of data/information created, captured, copied, and consumed worldwide) will reach 64.2 zettabytes in 2020 and increase to over 180 zettabytes by 2025. One zettabyte is approximately one billion terabytes. So, it indicates a very large amount of data is generated. We access a wide range of data daily, such as viewing Instagram posts, posting photos or comments on social networking sites, communicating with others, and researching things we don’t know about on websites. When we access data, we are also providing our own data to those websites and tech companies. In this blog post, I will explore what data tech companies collect and when and how they collect them. It also explores their intentions for collecting those data and then shows the impact they have on us in doing so (in this case, the beneficial impact and extensional risks they pose to us).

## The impact of tech companies on society
Tech companies have a wide range of impacts on the society that affect many aspects of our daily lives, including how we communicate with each other, work, daily life, and access information. Digital engagement by social media, streaming content, online shopping, and other activities has increased hundreds or even thousands of times over the past decade. [For example](https://www.domo.com/data-never-sleeps#data), in just one minute, 5.9M searches are made on Google, 66K photos are shared on Instagram, 231.4M messages are sent, $443K are spent for shopping on Amazon, and 500 hours of video are uploaded on YouTube. The largest tech companies in the world are Facebook (Meta), Apple, and Google.
>[More than 90%](https://internethealthreport.org/2018/90-of-the-world-uses-google-search/) of the world uses Google search. google collects data on billions of consumers worldwide every day, with data on [72%](https://www.security.org/resources/data-tech-companies-have/) of Google users in the US. [^3]

In this way, tech companies are collecting and tracking our data. Here is one question. **How much and what kind of data do these companies track?** We will explore this in the following text.

## Data collection
Recently, any web page that we visit will ask us to agree on essential cookies and privacy policy and need to choose whether we accept all cookies or not. By clicking 'Yes' or 'Agree' at the end of the privacy policy that appears when you open a web page, we allow companies to collect our data.

### What kind of data and how do they collect?
By agreeing to these, big tech companies can collect data as wide-ranging as our location, personal information, search history, online purchase history, and emails that have been sent and received. How such data is used depends on the type of business, but in many cases, it is used to display targeted advertising and to manage websites. The data companies are collecting is not only personal data such as name, date of birth, and email address but may also use image recognition and voice recognition to capture a user's appearance. According to [Clario](https://clario.co/blog/which-company-uses-most-data/), Airbnb, Instagram, Meta, and TikTok have the option to store photos of faces. Additionally, Twitter, Spotify, and Clubhouse, among others, use voice recognition.
These image and voice recognition requires access to the entire image libraries within the app, and accessing them can provide personalised advertising that is more tailored to the user's interests and behaviour. Major social media platforms such as Snapchat and Instagram track location and contact information across apps; Apple consistently tracks user location and contact information throughout apps such as Safari, Photos, Weather, Maps, and Messages. While it is also possible for users to refuse such location information, many apps ask for permission to track their exact location through the mobile phone's global positioning system. However, even if you refuse the app's permission, the app can still learn your location. For example, Facebook collects location-related data apart from the mobile phone's GPS, and these data can track a user's whereabouts through their IP address. In addition, Twitter 'requests' information about the user's current location. This information is obtained from signals such as IP addresses and device settings.[^6]
 Companies can use such location data to learn about income levels, the user's current location, school or workplace and shopping habits.


## Digital identities


## Problems with privacy policies and cookie consent
According to a Pew Research Center survey[^8] , only 9 % of Americans say they always read a company’s privacy policy before agreeing to its terms of service, and more than a third (36%) never read the privacy policy before agreeing. Although this study only included Americans, it is not limited to Americans. It would take too long to read and agree to all the privacy policies and cookies that appear when you open a website, and some websites even require you to agree before you can continue reading. Some people may even have to press consent as a normal part of the process since all websites appear these days.
>As well as using complex language, the BBC found that reading the terms of 15 popular sites would take almost nine hours in total.[^7]

According to a BBC survey, companies may be in breach of European data rules (the EU's General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR)), which companies must clearly explain to their customers how their personal data will be used. Also, article 12 says that communications to individuals about their data must be "concise, transparent, intelligible and easily accesible form, using clear and plain language, in particular for any information addressed specifically to a child". Even though the minimum age to use apps like YouTube and Facebook is 13 years old, the terms used in the privacy policy require a university education to understand and the specialized terms used are not in plain text that everyone can understand, which could lead to a breach of the regulation. However, it is not simply a matter of writing in plain language: Facebook has rewritten its privacy policy to a secondary school reading level, but its length has tripled to 12,000 words. [^5]The longest combined policy is found on Spotify, in which reading a text without a break takes an average of 53 minutes. It took an average of eight minutes to read Google's privacy policy and Netflix's combined policy, which were also the shortest. As you can see, privacy policies and cookie terms of use are long and difficult to read due to the use of technical terminology, and it seems like companies don't expect us to read them.



## Existential risks by collecting data


One of the existential risks of tech companies collecting data from users. One of these risks is that the conditions of consent are well established in the sense that researchers cannot make sure that the users have read the information of the consensual use of the user's personal information in their data collection.[^1]

In terms of privacy, if the data is being published in a public domain, more information is being collected than may think. For example, Clark et al.[^1] mention that a tweet consisting 140 characters consists of metadata that includes the precise location of the tweet being made, the user information, and what device it was sent from. If we take this into perspective whenever we make a tweet or a post on the public domain, there is an existential risk of personal information being leaked.

As mentioned above, the existential risk from data collection is the processing of the user's privacy. Keymolan[^2] explains that a desired initiative to signal trustworthiness is by ''staying close to current data ethic design strategies, explainability as a key design value in AI applications''. In an article written by Clark et al.[^1], several of these strategies were raised, one of them being transparency. Transparency explains how the data has been collected, but also the reason for the data collection and the safeguards that protect the privacy of the users[^1]. 

As shown in the Data collection part, one of the reasons tech companies collect user data is because they want to personalize advertising and content or measure the performance of ads which the tech giant Google does.[^4] This strategy is further raised in Keymolan where she explains that despite the simple explainability of complex information and processes needs to be understandable for people, explainable should, however, also be to the context of users.[^2]
