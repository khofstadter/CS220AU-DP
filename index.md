## Introduction
Before I started teaching the Autumn part of the Navigating the Digital World module in 2021 (the CS220AU) at the University of Essex, the module primarily looked at the field of digital identities and the digital world (e.g., password management, CV enhancements, the use of certain software and hardware for content production<!-- what else?-->).

<!-- explain that AU is more practical and SP more theoretical? -->

There was nothing wrong with this, of course. However, to make the module more in line with my own expertise and interests and more engaging for students, from 2021 onwards, my students have been developing their professional identities via setting up their own websites for resident modes of engagement with the web for their assignments (instead of simply submitting an essay in a Word or PDF file). This decision was based on my previous success at Anglia Ruskin University using this method [^Hofstadter2019SelfAndPeerAssessmentToolAndRationale] and by Dave White discussing the benefits of university students developing their resident modes of engagement with the Web not after graduation, but while being students.[^DaveWhite] 

[^Hofstadter2019SelfAndPeerAssessmentToolAndRationale]: Hofstädter, Krisztián. 2019 Self and peer assessment tool and rationale. This document was submitted as part of my Learning and Teaching (Higher Education) PG Certificate course at the Anglia Ruskin University, Cambridge. Available at [krishofstadter.com](https://krishofstadter.com/assets/docs/Hofstadter2019SelfAndPeerAssessmentToolAndRationale.pdf).

[^DaveWhite]: White, Dave. 2014 Visitors and Residents: Credibility. Oxford University. Published on [Youtube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kO569eknM6U). 

My first cohorts in 2021 could develop their websites with any website builder (e.g., [WordPress](https://wordpress.org/), [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com/), [Wix](https://www.wix.com/)) and populate them with whatever content they thought could help showcase their professional identities (e.g., CVs, portfolios, artistic work, blog posts). <!-- I could help them with WordPress and GitHub Pages. Actually they all had to have a GitHub account, but the website didn't have to be with GitHub. -->

In 2022, I refined the assignment and asked students to only develop websites with GitHub Pages, which helped produce more consistent portfolios across the cohort <!-- which then is easier to mark --> and allowed me to better monitor the development of these websites via students' GitHub repositories. Furthermore, to make the module more timely, I asked students to produce content on these websites that links digital identities and existential risks. Their content could either reflect on all links they found or on one more specifically. Inspired by the decolonizing of the curriculum movement <!-- it's not a movement, what is it -->[^decolonize], I thought there were other, perhaps more urgent matters all students should be aware of as well.

[^decolonize]: Arshad, Rowena 2021 Decolonising the curriculum – how do I get started? Published in [Times Higher Education](https://www.timeshighereducation.com/campus/decolonising-curriculum-how-do-i-get-started).


Feedback from students was positive, so the 2023 assignment brief was to look at the connections between digital identities and existential risks again, but this year, everyone had to focus on **one** specific connection to reflect on using their websites.

### Progress = happiness
#### Log, tasks lists, commit history, weekly student updates
#### Workshops
At ARU, I got used to syllabuses stating with weekly lectures and seminars and ending with three weeks of workshops in which workshops the focus is on understanding how students progressed so far and how the teacher can help untangle issues together with the group or individually with students. This time is very special. <!-- reference to Richard, CMT, ARU -->

## Linking the Fields
I certainly have an interest in both fields, but since I am trained as a creative technologist (I got a PhD in developing brain-computer music interfaces for meditation, have been producing audio-visual content as well as websites), and not as an existential risk 'person', my expertise lay more in the field of the digital world and not in existential risks. One might ask the question: "Why then are you teaching existential risks?" Well, I don't. My syllabus focuses on making sure students understand what digital identities are primarily through the VR methods and then provides both, academic research frameworks for students to first immerse in both fields and their intersections <!-- APM--> and professional content production skills <!-- GitHub, Markdown, writing and audio-visual --> to then engage with these intersections. <!-- I distinguish between these two -->  <!-- What are the A/Ds of not being an expert in existential risks? Do the disadvantages make me fell uncomfortable? -->

### Literature Review
1. who made connections already?
2. how can we find more connections?
3. how shall students choose a connection to focus on for the assignments? <!-- they should find something they are interested in, as this interest will (or should) help create a momentum/drive to progress with the assignment. -->

<!-- draft a diagram of the fields -->

## Conclusion
### Recommendations
These are my recommendations for teachers and students: 

### Next Steps
My next steps to further develop this module are 

- to consider asking CS220AU students to submit a short video summarizing their portfolios, similarly to my Sonic Art students in 2019:
