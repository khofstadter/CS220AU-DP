## Reflection on digital identities

This writing briefly reflects on my understanding of

- digital identities in general
- my digital identities in the past/present
- my digital identities in the future

<br>

### Digital identities
To help identify and improve my digital identities, I explored 
- [White et al.'s Visitor and Resident (V&R) concept](http://daveowhite.com/vandr/) which 

  - says this and that as well as that
  - and out of these, I found this and that interesting, and therefore researched them further and found this and that, etc. interesting in relation to existential risks (or a specific existential risk)

Note: The module outline has a file on digital identities, revise if needed. That file also contains a list of resources to consider e.g. journal papers, documentary films, etc. 

<br>

### My past/present digital identity/identities
Using the V&R map, I identified the following ways I engage with the Web in my visitor and resident modes (see photo/diagram below).

To clarify, in 

- my visiting mode, the primary activities are ...
- my resident mode, the primary activities are ...
- the difference between my personal and institutional modes is ...
- etc. 

<br>

### My future digital identity/identities
To help develop my digital identities I have

- revised my current use of digital identities (thought about it critically)
- discussed it with my cohort/friends/parents
- found this and that in journal papers/books/internet which helped me understand where and how I could improve 
- used a [SWOT](https://duckduckgo.com/?q=swot&t=brave&ia=web) analysis (or another method that can help personal development) to understand my next steps
- etc. 

Note: Don't just think about what needs improving, but also about what you are already doing effectively. A good starting point is to talk about the good things you already do and then dive into what needs improving. 

After identifying and analysing my current use of digital identities on the Web, I set the goal to ...

<br>

#### Objective 1 (example)
The above V&R map and its analysis highlighted ...

To address this (objective/weakness/threat, ...) I plan to 

- do this and that (read this and that, join a specific forum, amend/delete/add this or that, ...)
- by this deadline (perhaps you could write that you will set aside 1 hour every Monday to work on this objective)

<br>

#### Objective 2 (example)
...

By addressing these objectives my future V&R map will look as follows:

### Questions you should/could explore 
- do I know people who are much older than me and can use technology efficiently e.g. the Web more efficiently?
- what does it actually mean "to use the Web more efficiently"?
- what's the difference between White et al.'s and Prensky's idea regarding people engaging with technology?
- on the V&R map, what's the fundamental difference between 'visitor' modes and 'resident' modes and what does the 'personal on institutional' dimension provide?
- how have I been using digital technology in different contexts i.e. how has my 'digital journey' changed since my first device e.g. the one given to me by parents?
- how can/should I (or shouldn't) link my personal identities to my professional identities?
- what implications do my visitor identities have on my personal life?
- what implications do my personal identities have on my professional/institutional life?
- what implications do my resident identities have on my personal life?
- what implications do my resident identities have on my professional/institutional life?
- how do I assess the credibility of information of other people (or institutions) e.g. does it matter how good their profile picture looks or how well their website is designed? 
- how much fact-checking could people do when visiting my resident identities e.g. my websites or social accounts and who much fact-checking do I need to do when referencing others' work?
- is a piece of information's creditably in line with how high the information ranks using a search engine?
- is a piece of information's creditably in line with the creditability (or the number of followers) of a mainstream or alternative broadcaster, its references and perhaps who it was reviewed by? Can this information be biased or could there be a conflict of interest? 
- what does it mean to critically evaluate information i.e. what is critical thinking?
- how do I develop my critical thinking regarding my engagement on the Web in my visitor and resident modes?
- what is my digital capability e.g. what aspect of technology am I comfortable/uncomfortable with?
- how can I improve my online presence e.g. by monitoring the time I spend on social media vs. work when using my computing device?
- how can I improve the way I interact with information online e.g. can I access a more mindful/objective instead of a more reactive/emotional/biased state of mind before sharing or commenting on something online?
- what information about my developing digital identities am I confident sharing publicly?

### Thoughts
- maybe also have the two maps next to each other for easy comparison
