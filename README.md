# CS220AU Digital Portfolio 

## Overview
The goal of this GitHub repository is to serves as a template for the [CS220AU](https://navigatingthedigitalworld.com/docs/cs220au) assignment. It demonstrates minimalistic approaches to:

- project management using this `README.md` file, organized under the Overview, Tasks, and Log headings
- web hosting through [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com/)
- web design with [Markdown language](https://guides.github.com/features/mastering-markdown/)
- self- and peer-assessment via the `assessment.md` and `checklist.md` files

The URL for the website can be located in the sidebar, under the 'About' section. The homepage content is sourced from the `index.md` file.
